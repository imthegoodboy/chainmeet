Build a Privacy-focused Application with Aleo
Prove everything. Reveal nothing. Build apps that protect users by default.

This is not a hackathon. This is your pathway to building the future of the private internet. Welcome to the Privacy Buildathon powered by Aleo — a 3-month, progress-driven program where you don't just write code — you pioneer applications that protect users by default.

99% of blockchains expose everything. Every transaction, every interaction, every piece of data — permanently visible to the world. Aleo is different. As the only Layer-1 with programmable privacy by design, Aleo lets you build applications where users control what they share.

AKINDO is giving you the tools, mentors, and direct connections to turn your privacy-first vision into a funded, mainnet-ready product.

🧭 Start Here: Buildathon Kickoff & Developer Onboarding

Why Privacy? Why Now?
We live in an era of mass data collection. Every click, every purchase, every interaction is tracked, stored, and monetized. Traditional blockchains made this worse — putting financial and behavioral data on permanent public display.

Zero-knowledge cryptography changes everything.

The Aleo Advantage
Offchain Execution — Compute privately, verify publicly
Encrypted State — Data hidden by default
Private, but Compliant — Meet regulatory requirements through selective disclosure
Composability — Private contracts can interact seamlessly
Backed by a16z, SoftBank, and Samsung, Aleo is the infrastructure layer for the private internet.

The question is: What will you build when privacy is the default?

Build Privacy-Preserving Apps Across Every Vertical
Aleo's zero-knowledge architecture enables privacy in any application. Here are high-impact verticals where your innovation can shine:

💰 Private Finance (DeFi)
Private Prediction Markets
Private Trading & Liquidity
Shielded AMMs and DEXs — Positions, balances, and order sizes stay confidential.
Private Limit Orders, TWAP, or RFQ Systems — Eliminate MEV and front-running.
Smart Routers — Keep order routing logic and execution details hidden.
Dark Pools — Institutional-grade privacy on large trades.
Privacy-Preserving Credit & Lending
Undercollateralized Loans — Borrowers prove creditworthiness via ZK proofs.
Private Onchain Credit Scores — Verifiable but not fully transparent.
ZK-based Eligibility Checks — KYC, jurisdiction, and whitelisting without exposing raw data.
Cross-Chain Private Yield & Structured Products
Private Yield Vaults— Fueled by liquidity bridged from other chains.
Exotic DeFi Products — Options, tranches, rate products where individual positions remain private but system solvency is provable.
Strategy Aggregators — Hide per-user allocations while proving fair execution.
Institutional & Treasury DeFi
Treasury Tools — For funds, DAOs, and companies to keep strategies private while offering ZK proofs for compliance.
Private Payroll and B2B Payment Rails — Selective disclosure for auditors.
DeFi Rails for Regulated Entities — For those who cannot use fully transparent chains.
🆔 Private Identity & Credentials
Identity Verification — Prove age, citizenship, or credentials without revealing documents.
Private KYC/AML — Compliance without data exposure.
Anonymous Reputation Systems — Build trust without doxxing.
Credential Wallets — Store and selectively disclose certifications.
🗳️ Private Governance & Voting
Anonymous Voting — Vote without revealing your choice.
Private DAOs — Governance where member holdings stay confidential.
Whistleblower Systems — Report safely with cryptographic protection.
Private Polls and Surveys — Gather honest data without surveillance.
🧠 Privacy-Preserving AI & Data
Private ML Inference — Run AI models on encrypted data.
Confidential Data Marketplaces — Sell data without exposing it.
Private Analytics — Aggregate insights without individual tracking.
Secure MPC Protocols — Collaborate without sharing raw data.
🌐 Private Social & Communication
Anonymous Social Networks — Express freely without surveillance.
Private Messaging — Verify sender without revealing identity.
Confidential Content Platforms — Monetize without exposure.
Private Professional Networks — Network without revealing employer data.
You can port an existing project and rebuild it privacy-first on Aleo — or design something that only makes sense in a world where privacy is the default.
