🔐 ChainMeet (Privacy-First Web3 Meetings) — FULL EXPLANATION
1️⃣ USER POINT OF VIEW (MOST IMPORTANT FOR JUDGES)

Think like a normal user, not a blockchain dev.

👤 User Types
1. Guest / Attendee

Wants to join a private meeting

Does NOT want to reveal:

Name

Wallet

Company

Identity

2. Organizer / Host

Creates meetings

Sets rules (who can join)

Wants proof, not identity

🧑‍💻 USER FLOW (STEP BY STEP)
🔹 Step 1: User opens ChainMeet

Website looks like Zoom / Google Meet

Button: “Join Meeting” or “Create Meeting”

No login, no email.

🔹 Step 2: Connect Aleo Wallet (Silently)

User connects Aleo wallet

Wallet address is never shown

Used only to generate ZK proofs

👉 Important:
Wallet ≠ Identity

🔹 Step 3: Join a Meeting (ZK Proof Flow)

Meeting has rules like:

“Must be DAO member”

“Must hold NFT”

“Must be verified developer”

User clicks Join

Behind the scenes:

Wallet generates Zero-Knowledge Proof

Proof says:

“I satisfy the rule”

Proof does NOT reveal:

Wallet address

Token balance

NFT ID

Aleo contract verifies proof → Access granted

🔹 Step 4: Join Video Call (Anonymous)

User enters meeting as:

“Anonymous #42”

Video / audio is off-chain

Chat is encrypted

🔹 Step 5: Attendance Proof Stored

After meeting ends:

Aleo stores private attendance record

Later user can prove:

“I attended 5 DAO meetings”

Without revealing which ones.

2️⃣ WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES (CLEARLY)
Traditional Meet	ChainMeet
Email required	No email
Identity visible	Anonymous
Wallet exposed	Wallet hidden
Attendance tracked publicly	Private ZK proof
Centralized	Decentralized

This is privacy by default, exactly Aleo’s vision.

4️⃣ ALEO’S ROLE (THIS IS KEY FOR JUDGES)

Aleo is NOT just storage here.

Aleo handles:

Privacy

Verification

Access control

Proofs

Off-chain handles:

Video

Audio

UI

5️⃣ SMART CONTRACT ARCHITECTURE (LEO PROGRAMS)

You will NOT use one big contract.
You split logic (judges like this).

📦 1. meeting.leo

Handles:

Create meeting

Meeting ID

Rules

Meeting {
  meeting_id
  organizer_hash
  rule_hash
}

📦 2. eligibility.leo

Handles:

ZK proofs for joining

Token/NFT/DAO membership checks

Example:

Prove ownership of NFT X
Without revealing NFT ID

📦 3. attendance.leo

Handles:

Private attendance records

ZK aggregation

Example:

Prove attendance count ≥ 3

6️⃣ DETAILED TECH FLOW (JOIN MEETING)
🔁 What happens when user clicks “Join”

Frontend asks:

“Generate proof for rule X”

Wallet:

Runs Leo program locally

Creates ZK proof

Proof sent to:

Aleo contract

Aleo:

Verifies proof

Returns success/failure

Frontend:

If success → generate meeting access token

Join video room

No identity leak.
No wallet leak.
